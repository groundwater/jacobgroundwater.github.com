Wordpress was fun while it lasted, but the romance is over.
I am discontinuing my usage of wordpress,
and will be migrating my previous wordpress sites to static copies in the near future.

I have decided to migrate to Jekyll, a static site generator, written with markdown.

## Features

- Jekyll has zero maintenance - it is a static site
- Jekyll content generation can be distributed by using Git
- Jekyll can be updated offline
- Comments are loaded via a 3rd party plugin (i.e. Disqus)
