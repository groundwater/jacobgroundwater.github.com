		<description><![CDATA[Dependency injection can look elegant, or like a nightmare. I appreciate elegance, sometimes too much. In the last few months I've been learning the discipline of getting things done at the expense of elegance. I have been learning the Playframework, a rapid development platform using Scala, and blogging about my experiences. Although dependency injection is a more-or-less solved problem in Scala with the cake pattern, meshing it with play is a little more difficult. I would like a DI strategy that accommodates the easy mocking of controllers, actors and database without much effort. Some of my goals before proceeding: i don't want to revolve my code around it not yet another framework should not interfere with RAD the compiler should be able to notify me of problems (no casting) not a lot of thinking to get it right (get it right the first time) The road I set down, and ultimately settled upon is by using the Play plugins. Whether this road is practical and/or elegant remains to be seen. The main reason for plugins is because anything that loads via a plugin can be swapped out during testing. Thus, anything we need to mock must load via a plugin. From here there are two approaches, either: use micro-plugins, i.e. one for each controller, actor and database use a single, monolithic plugin A micro-plugin architecture would define a plugin for each controller, set of actors, and other testable components. Dependencies are injected via plugins at runtime. Plugins are capable of querying for other plugins when booting. While this would define an incredibly modular design, I think it's massive overkill. I want a design that is easy to understand at a single glance. The micro plugin approach requires many configuration lines in the play.plugins file. It's easy to miss one, and the compiler errors are not that helpful. In addition, in all your efforts to become modular you can accidentally couple your code in some other way. At some point in the future, I believe we will shift to a more modular design, but that idea is still immature and needs time to form. Thus we're left with monolithic plugins. Monolithic plugins are nice because all your wiring is in one place. There should be no surprises. A quick glance at the plugin code reveals all your applications configurations and components.

<p>What's nice is that the monolithic plugin is somewhat orthogonal to your dependency injection framework, you can define and wire your dependencies with the standard cake pattern.</p>
<h2>Use the Cake Pattern</h2>
<p>The cake pattern has been described as _slices_ of a cake. I prefer to think in terms of ingredients, or mixins.</p>
<pre><pre class="brush: scala; title: ; notranslate">
package controllers

case class Application(actor: ActorRef) extends Controller {
    def index = Action{...}
}

trait ApplicationMixin {
    val actor: ActorRef
    lazy val application = Application(actor)
}

object MixingBowl extends ApplicationMixin {
    val actor = current.actorOf(Props[MyActor])
}

// a valid application controller is avaialble
// at controllers.MixingBowl.application
</pre>
<h2>The Kitchen Pattern</h2>
<p>I would love to coin a new scale term, so here is my attempt. I present what I call the kitchen pattern for play applications, which is inspired by the following quote.</p>
<blockquote><p>All problems in computer science can be solved by another level of indirection</p></blockquote>
<p>The kitchen pattern <em>uses</em> the cake patter. It does not modify the cake ingredients, your dependency injection code remains <em>unchanged</em>. Instead the kitchen pattern is used to serve various cakes, depending on the requirements. The three components of the kitchen patter are:</p>
<ol>
<li>the menu (trait)</li>
<li>the chef (class)</li>
<li>the kitchen (object)</li>
</ol>
<p>The menu makes promises of what to expect, like a chocolate cake or an application controller. The chef decides <em>how</em> to bake the cake; different chefs can satisfy the menu in different ways. Your <code>test</code> chefs will serve up mock cakes, your production chef serves the real deal. The kitchen is necessary to combine the menu and chef. Without the kitchen, nothing gets made. In summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>there is one menu</li>
<li>there can be many chefs</li>
<li>there is one kitchen</li>
</ul>
<p>The kitchen pattern is another layer on top of the cake pattern. Keep the above cake pattern intact, but add the following:</p>
<pre><pre class="brush: scala; title: ; notranslate">
// --- Kitchen pattern --- //
package restaurant

import play.api.Play.current
import play.api.Plugin

trait Menu extends Plugin {
    val application: controllers.Application
}

class HeadChef(playapp: play.api.Application) extends Menu {
    val application = controllers.MixingBowl.application
}

object Kitchen {
    val menu: Menu = current.plugin(classOf[Menu]).get
}

// A pluggable controller is available at
// restaurant.Kitchen.menu.application
</pre>
<p>The head chef will not be found by the application unless it is listed as a plugin.<br />
Add the following to the <code>conf/play.plugins</code> file:</p>
<pre><pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate">5000:restaurant.HeadChef</pre>
<p>The number is used to weigh competing plugins, I use 5000 because that's what the plugin tutorial uses.</p>
<p>Our application will now load the head chef whenever running in production.</p>
<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>By having the router traverse the kitchen plugin, our application can be re-programmed at test time.</p>
<pre><pre class="brush: scala; title: ; notranslate">
class TestChef extends Menu {
    val application = // Mock Controller
}

class Test extends Specification {
    &quot;application&quot; should {
        &quot;load mock dependency&quot; in {
            running(TestServer(9000, FakeApplication(

            additionalPlugins = Seq(&quot;test.TestChef&quot;)

            )), HTMLUNIT) { browser =&amp;gt;
            browser.goTo(&quot;http://localhost:9000&quot;)
            // Test mock controller
            }
        }
    }
}
</pre>
<p>The TestChef plugin loaded by our test server will override the HeadChef. Since the application router traverses our kitchen, which has now load the test chef, and selenium tests will encounter mock controllers along the way. A mock controller can be used to test your views. Create additional chefs for mocking other components such as actors and databases.</p>
