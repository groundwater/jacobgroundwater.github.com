		<description><![CDATA[I created this blog to improve my writing and communication skills. While my spoken ability to explain complex topics seems highly developed, writing always gives me a hard time. Photo by magslhalliday Actually, writing to myself is fine, but that's the problem - I'm always writing to myself. When speaking I always consider the audience. I scale my dialogue to match it. With writing I always end up writing for myself. Sometimes I am the appropriate target, such as in notes to myself in the future, but I already have a wiki for those. Writing for a blog is different; I am very much not the intended target. As such, I intend to publish early and often, refining as I go. Feedback is important, so please comment! I envision this blog as my definitive resource that explains all my crazy ideas in my head, but targeted at a variety of audiences. This is why my blog is not static, I doubt I will ever get it right on the first try.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I created this website with the following tools or services Ubuntu Rackspace Cloud WordPress lighttpd Since the Rackspace instance only has 250MB memory, lighttpd performs much better than apache. The blog supports several ways to post comments. You can sign in using Facebook or Twitter, provided by Simple Facebook Connect Simple Twitter Connect Costs Other than time, my time, the only costs associated are the Rackspace hosting and GoDaddy domain registration. I prefer having my own virtualized image, in this case hosted in the cloud. It affords me root level access to the system to make any chances I deem necessary. The downside is an increased cost and I am ultimately responsible for the well being of the website. Rackspace Cloud Server - $15 / month GoDaddy Domain Name - $15 / year Bandwidth costs are minimal, I'm hosting my blog photo stream from flickr so the bandwidth comes from their servers, not mine. Collaboration If anyone is interested in having the same blog format hosted by me, we can share the cost and perhaps even upgrade the server instance. It would have to be done my way, i.e. you get the same setup. Of course you'd have your own domain name and blog theme.]]></description>
