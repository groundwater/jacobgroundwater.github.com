			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Case Classes</h2>
<p>I wish to share and record some of my recent insights into the Scala language. I have been trying to wrap my head around case classes. These are very terse class definitions, but end up being extremely useful. Most of the case classes I've run across are defined in a single line:</p>
<pre><pre class="brush: scala; title: ; notranslate">
case class Demo( title : String, author : String )
</pre>
<p>What isn't immediately obvious is what the compiler does upon encountering a case class definition. This is roughly translated into the Java code</p>
<pre><pre class="brush: java; title: ; notranslate">
public class Demo {
    public final String title;
    public final String author;
    public Demo( String title, String author ) {
        this.title = title;
        this.author = author;
    }
}
</pre>
<p>I have to admit, this is a data pattern that I use often. I like my objects simple. As such, having the ability to define them in a single line is pretty nice. I hope the following is immediately clear:</p>
<pre><pre class="brush: scala; title: ; notranslate">
case class Demo( title : String, author : String )

val demo = Demo( title = &quot;How to win at Blackjack&quot;, author = &quot;Jacob&quot; )

println(&quot;My Demo : &quot; + demo.title )
println(&quot; by : &quot; + demo.author )
</pre>
<p>By default, case classes define their members with <code>val</code>, that is they are immutable. In Scala <code>val</code> is like the Java <code>final</code> modifier. This can be overridden by explicitly using <code>var</code>.</p>
<pre><pre class="brush: scala; title: ; notranslate">
case class Demo( var title : String, var author : String )
</pre>
<h3>More</h3>
<p>Now what's really interesting is how helpful the Scala compiler can be. After processing, a case class is no different than a regular class.</p>
<p>Suppose we begin with:</p>
<pre><pre class="brush: scala; title: ; notranslate">
case class Product( var price : Double )
</pre>
<p>which is called by the client code:</p>
<pre><pre class="brush: scala; title: ; notranslate">
val iPhone = Product( 499.99 )
println( iPhone.price )

// Discount
iPhone.price = 399.99
println( iPhone.price )
</pre>
<p>As our code base becomes larger, we wish to add more sanity checks to the code, we want it to fail fast. Thus products with negative prices should not be allowed.</p>
<p>We can add this behavior to our <code>Product</code> <em>without</em> modifying the client code.</p>
<pre><pre class="brush: scala; title: ; notranslate">
class Product {
    private var _price : Double = 0
    def price = _price
    def price_= ( price : Double ) {
        if (price &lt; 0) throw new Exception(&quot;Prices cannot be negative&quot;)
        _price = price
    }
}
object Product {
    def apply( price : Double ) = {
        val p = new Product()
        p.price = price
        p
    }
}
</pre>
<p>This is much more verbose, but it's only necessary when we require <em>more</em> behavior than the case class provides. Further more, the original client code works unmodified! Fantastic.</p>
<h2>Pattern Matching</h2>
<p>Case classes are often paired with Scala pattern matching, much like a <code>switch</code> statement but more powerful.</p>
<pre><pre class="brush: scala; title: ; notranslate">
case class Hello( greeting : String )
case class Goodbye( valediction : String )

def send( x : Any ) = {
    x match {
        case hello:Hello =&gt; 
            printf( &quot;Received Greeting: %s&quot;, hello.greeting )
        case goodbye:Goodbye =&gt; 
            printf( &quot;Received valediction: %s&quot;, goodbye.valediction )
    }
}

send( Hello(&quot;Good morning&quot;) )
send( Goodbye(&quot;See you tomorrow&quot;) )
</pre>
<p>The compiler will ensure that, even though <code>send</code> accepts <code>Any</code> type, each case specified in the match statement will be properly typed. That is, in <code>case hello:Hello => ...</code> the <code>hello</code> object has the proper type, and we can call methods associated with <code>Hello</code>.</p>
<p>At this point, we can divide cases by opaque types. Scala also supports a more granular approach, types can be made transparent to the pattern matcher<sup><a href="../../../584/learning-scala-case-classes-and-pattern-matching/index.html#footnote_0_584" id="identifier_0_584" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="See this reddit comment for a more complete example.">1</a></sup>,</p>
<pre><pre class="brush: scala; title: ; notranslate">
case class Grade( letter : String, passed : Boolean )

def check( grade : Grade ) = {
    grade match {
        case Grade(letter,true)  =&gt; 
            printf( &quot;You have passed with grade: %s&quot;, letter )
        case Grade(letter,false) =&gt; 
            printf( &quot;You have failed with grade: %s&quot;, letter )
    }
}

check( Grade(&quot;A&quot;,true) )
check( Grade(&quot;F&quot;,false) )
</pre>
<p>For matches that require more precision, </p>
<pre><pre class="brush: scala; title: ; notranslate">
case class Grade( score : Double )

def check( grade : Grade ) = {
    grade match {
        case Grade(score) if (score &gt;= 0.5) =&gt; 
            printf( &quot;You have passed with score: %2.1f%%&quot;, score*100 )
        case Grade(score) =&gt; 
            printf( &quot;You have failed with score: %2.1f%%&quot;, score*100 )
    }
