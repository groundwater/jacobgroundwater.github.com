<p>Just for kicks, I threw in dependency injection because it fits well with creating an actor-messaging framework.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Play routes incoming HTTP requests to <code>Controllers</code>, these are objects you create. A controller can do it all if you wish, it can process the entire request all the way down to accessing the database, but that was not my goal. Below is an example of a totally synchronous design, where the controller handles everything:</p>
<p><img src='../../../wp-content/gallery/play/akkasync.png' alt='akkasync' class='ngg-singlepic ngg-none' /></p>
<p>Time to throw some actors into the mix.</p>
<p>Instead of programming the business logic directly in the controller, a message object encapsulating the request will be fired off to a background Actor asynchronously. The controller is then immediately free to handle more incoming requests. The response is no longer sent from the controller, but from a one-time object called a Future or Promise that awaits the actors reply.</p>
<p><img src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/03/AkkaAsync.png" alt="" title="AkkaAsync" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-706" /></p>
<p>Actors and Controllers are permanent parts of the system. Futures and messages exist only during a request.</p>
<p><img src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/03/AkkaAll.png" alt="" title="AkkaAll" width="787" height="451" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-708" /></p>
<p>Actors can be as simple or as complicated as necessary. For example different actors could be in charge of different business objects in the system. Alternatively one actor could handle everything, dividing messages up by convenient case-classes and pattern matching.<sup><a href="../../../702/playing-with-actors/index.html#footnote_0_702" id="identifier_0_702" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="See my previous post Learning Scala: Case Classes and Pattern Matching">1</a></sup></p>
<h2>Talking to Actors</h2>
<p>The controller will look like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="brush: scala; title: ; notranslate">
class Application( val actor: ActorRef ) extends Controller {
    
    def index = Action { implicit request =&gt;
        
        // Talk to actor
        
    }
}
</pre>
<p>As the controller receives a request, it will be forwarded to the relevant actor by way of an asynchronous message. Since eventually the browser of our website will expect a reply, it's not as simple as:</p>
<pre><pre class="brush: scala; title: ; notranslate">
actor ! message
</pre>
<p>We need to process the request then send a reply while maintaining the context and scope of the open client connection. Play provides a sort of boilerplate solution for us:</p>
<pre><pre class="brush: scala; title: ; notranslate">
class Application( val actor: ActorRef ) extends Controller {
    
    implicit val timeout : Timeout = Timeout(Duration(5,&quot;seconds&quot;))
    
    def index = Action { implicit request =&gt;
        
        Async {
            new AkkaPromise( actor ? &quot;Incoming Message!&quot; ) map {

                // Handle Reply

            }
        }        
    }
}
</pre>
<p>The code <code>Async</code> and <code>AkkaPromise</code> handle the <code>Future</code> returned by <code>`actor ? message`</code> that will eventually contain our reply back to the users browser.<sup><a href="../../../702/playing-with-actors/index.html#footnote_1_702" id="identifier_1_702" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Read more about Async in the Scala Async API">2</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Note</em>: This does not handle timeouts gracefully. This is left as an exercise to the reader... and myself.</p>
<h3>Better Communication</h3>
<p>Actors represent the business logic of the system. As such, they don't really need to know any HTTP details. The controller's job is thus to parse the HTTP request into a more generic request that the actors would prefer.</p>
<p>The power of case classes will come into play. Case classes are the meat and potatoes of actor messaging. Need a specific kind of message? Make a case class. Let's make one now, something simple.</p>
<pre><pre class="brush: scala; title: ; notranslate">
case class Get(path: String)
</pre>
<p>By using case classes the compiler will help check our message logic. Now the controller can send better messages</p>
<pre><pre class="brush: scala; highlight: [8]; title: ; notranslate">
class Application( val actor: ActorRef ) extends Controller {
    
    implicit val timeout : Timeout = Timeout(Duration(5,&quot;seconds&quot;))
    
    def index = Action { implicit request =&gt;
        
        Async {
            new AkkaPromise( actor ? Get(request.path) ) map {

                // Handle Reply

            }
        }        
    }
}
</pre>
<p>The actor receiving the message can easily parse this using pattern matching:</p>
<pre><pre class="brush: scala; highlight: [3]; title: ; notranslate">
class Getter extends Actor {
    def receive = {
        case Get(path) =&gt; 
            // Get and process your data using `path`
            // Create and send a response
            sender ! response
    }
}
</pre>
<p>The final line <code>sender ! response</code> will trigger the controllers asynchronous reply (line 10).</p>
<h2>Dependency Injection</h2>
<p>I'm going to pollute the focus of this article by also addressing dependency injection. Injecting actors into controllers feels like the right thing to do; I call it gut programming! So let's do it.</p>
<p>I am using what I understand to be the cake pattern<sup><a href="../../../702/playing-with-actors/index.html#footnote_2_702" id="identifier_2_702" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="See Real-World Scala: Dependency Injection by Jonas Bon&eacute;r /">3</a></sup>. This is by far the most delicious sounding of all dependency injection frameworks, although Google Guice is a close second.</p>
<p>IMHO your objects do not need to know about the injection framework. If your object has a dependency, put it in the constructor.<sup><a href="../../../702/playing-with-actors/index.html#footnote_3_702" id="identifier_3_702" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="The val is necessary if you wish to later reference the parameter by object.actor">4</a></sup></p>
<pre><pre class="brush: scala; title: ; notranslate">
class Application( val actor: ActorRef ) extends Controller {
    
    def index = Action { 

        // Use `actor` here

    }

}
</pre>
<p>For each class that requires injection, we add a trait that acts as the injector:</p>
<pre><pre class="brush: scala; title: ; notranslate">
trait ApplicationInjector {
    
    // To be injected by a mixing bowl
    val applicationActor: ActorRef 
    
    // must be `lazy val` or `def` otherwise it will not inject properly
    lazy val application: Application = 
        new Application(applicationActor)
    
}
</pre>
<p>In the above case, we directly create an injected object. You can also create a subclass within the injector where dependencies are pre-filled.</p>
<pre><pre class="brush: scala; title: ; notranslate">
trait ApplicationInjector {
    
    // To be injected by a mixing bowl
    val applicationActor: ActorRef 
    
    class InjectedApplication extends 
        Application( applicationActor )
    
}
</pre>
<p>To handle the injections, use a mixing bowl:</p>
<pre><pre class="brush: scala; title: ; notranslate">
object MixingBowl extends ApplicationInjector {
    
    val applicationActor = system.actorOf( 
        Props[Getter], name=&quot;application&quot; 
    )
    
}
</pre>
<p>There is now a fully injected application controller at <code>MixingBowl.application</code>.<sup><a href="../../../702/playing-with-actors/index.html#footnote_4_702" id="identifier_4_702" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Although I haven&#039;t really covered it here, this pattern is necessary to survive more complicated injection setups.">5</a></sup></p>
<h2>Full Example</h2>
<p>The full example, with lots of comments is hosted on github. The names of classes and objects have been changed slightly to protect the innocent.</p>
