		<description><![CDATA[The Standard Model in Physics explains everything we see and feel in the universe today, but remains utterly inaccessible to almost everyone Having gone through close to 40 math courses in my academic career, I can tell you without doubt that math notation, in all instance, sucks. I believe it is needlessly complicated, obfuscated, inauspicious and often full of erroneous assumptions. Least of all, it's difficult to learn. Science makes new discoveries by standing on the shoulders of giants - WikiMedia Commons The great insights of modern science, such as quantum mechanics, relativity, the standard model, are rooted in complex mathematical notation. Each theory supposedly explains its own slice of the universe, but all are generally inaccessible to even those schooled advanced mathematics, let alone the casual observer. Today there exists a generation unlike any before, a group of people growing up with unprecedented access to information via the internet. To most online-savvy individuals, questions are merely a few Google searches away from answers. For example many individuals can now make informed health decisions once delegated purely to medical professionals. There exist fully interactive 3D visualizations of the body's interior. Knowledge with the aid of a computer is suddenly accessible like never before. Why then is mathematics still so inaccessible? While there are emerging tools such as Wolfram Alpha, I think something is still missing. Mathematical objects are abstract - we cannot interact with them the same way that one can interact with a ball, a rock or even a distant planet. Balls can be bounced, rocks can be weighed and even distant planets can be directly observed through a telescope. Mathematical objects are not tangible, cannot be seen and have no physical analogue with which to compare. We learn about mathematics by moving notation around, thinking, and then if possible performing some type of visualization like a graph. This is tedious work, and it often interferes with the learning process. I think math notation needs to be computer friendly. In technical terms we need type-safe notation; those wishing for more detail will have to wait for my next post. We need a way to iteratively and incrementally learn more mathematics in a recreational fashion much as we can learn about biology and the planets. Math needs more consistent and computer-friendly notation so users can transfer their knowledge between branches and so I can ask a computer how to interact with the objects being described. I will present my own ideas in subsequent posts. In the meantime, please let me know your thoughts and opinions.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I created this blog to improve my writing and communication skills. While my spoken ability to explain complex topics seems highly developed, writing always gives me a hard time. Photo by magslhalliday Actually, writing to myself is fine, but that's the problem - I'm always writing to myself. When speaking I always consider the audience. I scale my dialogue to match it. With writing I always end up writing for myself. Sometimes I am the appropriate target, such as in notes to myself in the future, but I already have a wiki for those. Writing for a blog is different; I am very much not the intended target. As such, I intend to publish early and often, refining as I go. Feedback is important, so please comment! I envision this blog as my definitive resource that explains all my crazy ideas in my head, but targeted at a variety of audiences. This is why my blog is not static, I doubt I will ever get it right on the first try.]]></description>
